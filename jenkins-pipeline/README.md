# Jenkins Pipeline Setup Guide for Smart Traffic Switching: A Blue-Green Deployment Solution

This guide will walk you through setting up the Jenkins pipeline from scratch, including initial Jenkins setup, plugin installation, and configuration for Smart Traffic Switching of the Trainbooking application. The pipeline is designed for a Blue-Green Deployment strategy, ensuring seamless updates with minimal downtime.

---

## Prerequisites

1. **Jenkins Installed and Configured**:
   - An EC2 server setup running Jenkins, with Java, Docker, and Trivy installed and accessible over the browser. Kind see **[Infrastructure Setup](https://github.com/Godfrey22152/Smart-Traffic-Switching-A-Blue-Green-Deployment-Solution/tree/main/Infrastructure-Setup)** in the project `README` for a detailed guide.
   - Install necessary plugins: `Docker Pipeline`, `Docker`, `Eclipse Temurin Installer`, `SonarQube Scanner`, `Config File Provider`, `Maven Integration`, `Pipeline Maven Integration`, `Kubernetes Credentials`, `Kubernetes CLI`, `Kubernetes Client API`, `Kubernetes` and `Pipeline: Stage View`.

2. **Credentials Setup**:
   - `git-cred`: GitHub credentials to access the repository.
   - `docker-cred`: DockerHub credentials for pushing Docker images.
   - `k8-cred`: Kubernetes Secret credential to access the cluster through service account.
   - `sonar-server`: SonarQube server configuration Token.
   - `email-cred`: Gmail app-password for Email Notification.

3. **[Tools Installed on Jenkins Node](https://github.com/Godfrey22152/Smart-Traffic-Switching-A-Blue-Green-Deployment-Solution/tree/main/Infrastructure-Setup#ci-aws-ec2-instance-for-jenkins-sonarqube-and-nexus)**:
   - Java Development Kit (JDK 17).
   - Maven (version 3 or later).

   - Docker CLI and Kubernetes CLI (`kubectl`).
   - Kind see **[Infrastructure Setup](https://github.com/Godfrey22152/Smart-Traffic-Switching-A-Blue-Green-Deployment-Solution/tree/main/Infrastructure-Setup)** in the project `README` for a detailed guide.

4. **[Kubernetes Cluster](https://github.com/Godfrey22152/Smart-Traffic-Switching-A-Blue-Green-Deployment-Solution/tree/main/Infrastructure-Setup#cd-eks-cluster-setup)**:
   - A cluster set up with **[Service Account](https://github.com/Godfrey22152/Smart-Traffic-Switching-A-Blue-Green-Deployment-Solution/blob/main/Jenkins_ServiceAccount_RBAC_Scripts)** to allow Jenkins Access.
   - Install Helm for installing Nginx ingress.
   - Install Nginx ingress controller.
       
---
## Complete Kubernetes Cluster Setup
In your Kubernetes Cluster,  

### install helm 
   ```bash
   curl -o /tmp/helm.tar.gz -LO https://get.helm.sh/helm-v3.10.1-linux-amd64.tar.gz
   tar -C /tmp/ -zxvf /tmp/helm.tar.gz
   mv /tmp/linux-amd64/helm /usr/local/bin/helm
   chmod +x /usr/local/bin/helm
   ```

### Install Nginx ingress controller.
   You can find the Kubernetes NGINX documentation **[here](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/)**
   First thing we do is check the compatibility matrix to ensure we are deploying a compatible version of NGINX Ingress on our Kubernetes cluster.

   The Documentation also has a link to the **[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/)** which has a compatibility matrix.

 - **Get the installation YAML**
   The controller ships as a `helm` chart, so we can grab version `v1.11.3` as per the compatibility matrix.

   From our container we can do this:

   ```bash
   helm repo add ingress-nginx https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx
   helm search repo ingress-nginx --versions
   ```

   From the app version we select the version that matches the compatibility matrix.

   ```bash
   NAME                            CHART VERSION   APP VERSION     DESCRIPTION
   ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx     4.11.3          1.11.3          Ingress controller for Kubernetes using NGINX a...
   ```
   Now we can use helm to install the chart directly if we want.
   Or we can use helm to grab the manifest and explore its content.
   We can also add that manifest to our git repo if we are using a GitOps workflow to deploy it.

   ```bash
   CHART_VERSION="4.11.3"
   APP_VERSION="1.11.3"

   mkdir ./nginx-ingress-manifests

   helm template nginx-ingress ingress-nginx \
   --repo https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx \
   --version ${CHART_VERSION} \
   --namespace ingress-nginx \
   --set controller.service.type=LoadBalancer \
   > ./nginx-ingress-manifests/installation_nginx_ingress.${APP_VERSION}.yaml
   ```
 - **Deploy the Ingress controller**
   ```bash
   kubectl create namespace ingress-nginx
   kubectl apply -f ./nginx-ingress-manifests/installation_nginx_ingress.${APP_VERSION}.yaml
   ```

 - **Check the installation**
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n ingress-nginx
   ```
   ```bash
   NAME                                                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE
   pod/nginx-ingress-ingress-nginx-controller-6ffbff94df-td7pr   1/1     Running   0             5m
   ```
 - **Check the Nginx Ingress Service**

   ```bash
   kubectl get svc -n ingress-nginx
   NAME                                               TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP      PORT(S)                      AGE
   nginx-ingress-ingress-nginx-controller             LoadBalancer   10.105.156.69   XXXXXXXXXXXXXX   80:31507/TCP,443:31539/TCP   5m
   nginx-ingress-ingress-nginx-controller-admission   ClusterIP      10.98.183.68    <none>           443/TCP                      5m
   ```

#### Creating Credentials in Jenkins

To securely store credentials in Jenkins, follow these steps for each type of credential required by the pipeline.

##### 1. Git Credentials (`git-cred`) - Username with Password

1. Go to **Dashboard** > **Manage Jenkins** > **Manage Credentials**.
2. Select the appropriate domain **(global)**
3. Click **Add Credentials**.
4. In the **Kind** dropdown, select **Username with password**.
5. Fill in the following fields:
   - **Username**: Enter your Git username.
   - **Password**: Enter your Git password or personal access token.
   - **ID**: Enter `git-cred` (The ID I used in my pipeline).
   - **Description**: Provide a description for easy identification (e.g., "Git Credentials for Pipeline").
6. Click **OK** to save the credential.

##### 2. SonarQube PAT (`sonar-token`) - Secret Text

1. Go to **Dashboard** > **Manage Jenkins** > **Manage Credentials**.
2. Select the appropriate domain  **(global)**
3. Click **Add Credentials**.
4. In the **Kind** dropdown, select **Secret text**.
5. Fill in the following fields:

   - **Password**: Enter your Docker Hub password or access token.
   - **ID**: Enter `docker-cred` (The ID I used in my pipeline).
   - **Description**: Provide a description (e.g., "Docker Credentials for Pipeline").
6. Click **OK** to save the credential.

##### 4. K8s Service Account Secret (`k8-cred`) - Secret Text

1. Go to **Dashboard** > **Manage Jenkins** > **Manage Credentials**.
2. Select the appropriate domain **(global)** 
3. Click **Add Credentials**.
4. In the **Kind** dropdown, select **Secret text**.

   - **ID**: Enter `k8-cred` (The ID I used in my pipeline).
   - **Description**: Provide a description (e.g., "Kubernetes Service Account Token for Deployment").
6. Click **OK** to save the credential.

##### 5. Email Credentials (`email-cred`) - Username with Password

1. Go to **Dashboard** > **Manage Jenkins** > **Manage Credentials**.
2. Select the appropriate domain **(global)**
3. Click **Add Credentials**.
4. In the **Kind** dropdown, select **Username with password**.
5. Fill in the following fields:
   - **Username**: Enter your email service Email address.
   - **Password**: Enter your email service `**app passwords**`.
   - **ID**: Enter `email-cred` (The ID I used in my pipeline).
   - **Description**: Provide a description (e.g., "Email Credentials for Jenkins Notifications").
6. Click **OK** to save the credential.

**NOTE**:
You are expected to generate google app passwords for the GMAIL Email Notification. This app password is what you are expected to use to create Email credentials and not your real Email password. Here is how to generate one: 
- Go to `https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords`
- Provide an `App Name` which can be any name and click `Create` to generate app password.
- Copy app password and use it to create your Email credential (email-cred), also use it as password for E-mail Notification.

This completes the credential setup in Jenkins for Git, SonarQube, Docker, Kubernetes, and Email. Each credential ID will be referenced in the pipeline stages as needed.


### 6. Config File Management
- Go to `**Dashboard**` > `**Manage Jenkins**` > `**Managed files**`
- Click on `Add a new config` and select `Global Maven settings.xml`
- Scroll down to the buttom of the page and find `ID` ID of the config file.
- Clear the content of the `ID` and enter `maven-settings`, then click `Next`
- scroll down to `**Server Credentials**` > `**Content**` then scroll the `content` box to find `servers` section.
- Uncomment the server section in the content box and add your Nexus  server credential details: 

```bash
    <server>
      <id>maven-releases</id>
      <username>admin</username>
      <password>odo</password>
    </server>
    
    <server>
      <id>maven-snapshots</id>
      <username>admin</username>
      <password>odo</password>
    </server>
```

#### NOTE
In this step, we set up a global Maven settings.xml file to manage credentials securely for our Maven repository (e.g., Nexus). By defining this configuration in Jenkins, we ensure that the pipeline can access the repository with appropriate credentials without hard-coding sensitive information into the pipeline script. This also allows centralized management of configuration files, making it easier to update and maintain. Additionally, by specifying credentials under Server Credentials, we can manage multiple environments (such as maven-releases and maven-snapshots) and ensure the correct permissions are applied when Jenkins interacts with these repositories. **(SEE SCREENSHOT IMAGES IN THE SCREENSHOT SECTION)**


### 7. Configure SonarQube servers

- Go to `**Dashboard**` > `**Manage Jenkins**` > `**System**` > `**SonarQube servers**`
- Click `Add SonarQube` and provide the following: 
    - Name as:  `sonar-server`
    - Server URL with your SonarQube server URL: `http://<Public-IP>:9000`
    - Server authentication token: Your Generated SonarQube PAT and added as a credential in my case `sonar token.`


#### How to Generate SonarQube Personal Access Token (PAT) from your SonarQube Server:
- While logged-in in your SonarQube server, locate and click `**Administration**` at the top of the page.
- Under the `**Administration**` page, select `**Security**` > `**Users**` > `**Tokens**` to generate token.
- Click the box under the `Tokens` section to generate token.
- Enter token name in my case: `sonar-token`, generate and copy the token to a safe place.
- Create a credential following the steps mentioned in the credentials section above to create the SonaQube Server authentication token afterwards, you will add the generated PAT as a secret text. **(SEE SCREENSHOT IMAGES IN THE SCREENSHOT SECTION)**


### 8. Configure Email Notification and Extended E-mail Notification 

- Go to `**Dashboard**` > `**Manage Jenkins**` > `**System**` > Find `**Extended E-mail Notification**` and `**Email Notification**` 
- Fill in the Forms as shown in the screenshoots below to configure both `**Extended E-mail Notification**` and `**Email Notification**`. 

#### Extended E-mail Notification and E-mail Notification configuration

##### Extended E-mail Notification configuration
![Extended E-mail Notification ](screenshots/extended-email.png)

##### E-mail Notification configuration
![E-mail Notification ](screenshots/email.png)

- After setting up `E-mail Notification` click the button below `**Test configuration by sending test e-mail**`

##### NOTE:
You are expected to generate google app passwords for the GMAIL Email Notification. This app password is what you are expected to use to create Email credentials and not your real Email password. Here is how to generate one: 
- Go to `https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords`
- Provide an `App Name` which can be any name and click `Create` to generate app password.
- Copy app password and use it to create your Email credential (email-cred), also use it as password for E-mail Notification.

### The Pipeline Code
Refer to the full pipeline code **[Here](https://github.com/Godfrey22152/Smart-Traffic-Switching-A-Blue-Green-Deployment-Solution/blob/main/Jenkinsfile)**.

---
### NOTE: Pipeline Stage Code Generation using Pipeline Syntax

To generate code for each pipeline stage in Jenkins, use the **Pipeline Syntax** tool. This tool provides a user-friendly interface to create pipeline snippets for various steps, which you can then copy and paste into your pipeline script.

Follow these steps to generate the code for each stage:

1. **Access Pipeline Syntax**:
   - In Jenkins, navigate to your pipeline project.
   - Click on **Pipeline Syntax** in the left-hand menu.

2. **Select Step Type**:
   - In the **Sample Step** dropdown, choose the type of action you want to perform in the pipeline stage (e.g., `git:Git` for cloning a repository, `sh` for shell commands, `withMaven` for Maven steps, withSonarQubeEnv for SonarQube Server, withKubeConfig: Configure Kubernetes CLI (kubectl), etc.).

3. **Configure Parameters**:
   - Fill in the required fields for the chosen step, such as repository URL for `git`, command for `sh`, or other options specific to the step.

4. **Generate Pipeline Script**:
   - Once all fields are filled, click **Generate Pipeline Script**.
   - Copy the generated code and insert it into your pipeline script at the appropriate stage.

Repeat these steps for each stage in your pipeline to quickly build the code structure for all actions. This approach ensures accuracy and simplifies the creation of complex Jenkins pipeline configurations.

## Steps to Run the Jenkins Pipeline

To execute the pipeline in Jenkins, follow these streamlined steps:

1. **Verify Setup and Configuration**
   - Ensure all plugins are installed, including Git, Maven, Docker, Trivy, SonarQube, and Kubernetes CLI.
   - Check that credentials (`git-cred`, `sonar-token`, `docker-cred`, `k8-cred`, `email-cred`) are configured.
     
2. **Ensure all Necessary Manifest Files are added and updated**  
   - Ensure the Kubernetes manifest files are available in the **[Manifest_Files](https://github.com/Godfrey22152/Smart-Traffic-Switching-A-Blue-Green-Deployment-Solution/tree/main/Manifest_Files)** directory of the project repository:
     - `app-deployment-blue.yaml`
     - `app-deployment-green.yaml`
     - `trainbook-secrets.yaml`
     - `trainbook-service.yaml`
     - `trainbook-ingress.yaml`

3. **Run the Pipeline**  
   - Navigate to the newly created pipeline job in Jenkins.
   - Click on **"Build with Parameters"**.
   - Set the parameters for the pipeline:
     - `DEPLOY_ENV`: Choose the deployment environment (`blue` or `green`).
     - `DOCKER_TAG`: Specify the Docker image tag to use (`blue` or `green`).
     - `SWITCH_TRAFFIC`: Toggle the traffic switch box to `true` or leave it unchecked if you don't want the traffic switched from the default `blue` environment.
   - Click **"Build"** to start the pipeline.

4. **Monitor the Pipeline Execution**  
   - View the **console output** to monitor each stage of the pipeline.
   - Confirm that each stage completes successfully.

5. **Verify Deployment**  
   - View **console build output** to verify the deployment:
     - Check that pods, services, and ingress resources in the namespace `webapps` are deployed as specified in the pipeline.
     - Confirm the traffic has been switched (if applicable).
     - If successfully deployed you should see output as shown below (For the `blue` environment):
       
       ```bash
       + kubectl get pods -l version=blue -n webapps
       NAME                                  READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
       trainbook-app-blue-556b67bb58-vg8z7   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          19s
       + kubectl get svc trainbook-service -n webapps
       NAME                TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
       trainbook-service   ClusterIP   10.110.140.55   <none>        80/TCP    64s
       + kubectl get ingress trinbook-ingress -n webapps
       NAME               CLASS   HOSTS           ADDRESS          PORTS   AGE
       trinbook-ingress   nginx   trainbook.com   XXXXXXXXXXXXXX   80      68s
       ```

6. **Review Notifications**
   - The pipeline sends an email with the build status. Verify that notifications are correctly set up for alerts on build status.
     
7. **Verify Pod Readiness**
   - Check that the `trainbook-app` pod in either the **blue** or **green** environments are running and ready:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -l version=blue -n webapps
   kubectl get pods -l version=green -n webapps
   ```
   - Ensure the `READY` column shows `1/1` and the `STATUS` is `Running` as shown below:
   
     ```bash
     NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS     AGE
     trainbook-app-blue-556b67bb58-vg8z7   1/1     Running   0            65m  
     trainbook-app-green-67bcb8d89d-jcg2k  1/1     Running   0            30m
     ```
8. **Verify Service Configuration**
   - Confirm that the `trainbook-service` is running and exposing the application correctly:

     ```bash
     kubectl get svc trainbook-service -n webapps
     
     NAME                TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
     trainbook-service   ClusterIP   10.110.140.55   <none>        80/TCP    2h
     ```
     - Ensure the service type is **ClusterIP** and the port is `80/TCP`.
  
9. **Verify Ingress Configuration**
   - Check the status of the ingress resource:

     ```bash
     kubectl get ingress trinbook-ingress -n webapps
     
     NAME               CLASS   HOSTS           ADDRESS          PORTS   AGE
     trinbook-ingress   nginx   trainbook.com   XXXXXXXXXXXXXX   80      2h
     ```
     - Confirm the following:
       - The `HOSTS` column contains `trainbook.com`.
       - The `ADDRESS` column displays the correct external IP (e.g., `ae33145266d546673c0263t678cb19a31540-1815147026.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com`).
       - The `PORTS` column includes port `80`.

10. **Update Public DNS Records**
    - To make `trainbook.com` accessible remotely, update your public DNS records to point to the **external IP** or **hostname** of the ingress (e.g., `ae33145266d546673c0263t678cb19a31540-1815147026.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com`):
       1. Log in to your domain registrar's DNS management console.
       2. Add a DNS Record with the following details:
          - **Record Type:** `A` (if using an external IP address) or `CNAME` (if using an external hostname like an AWS ELB).
          - **Host/Name:** `@` or `trainbook.com` (leave blank or use `@` for root domain settings).
          - Value:
            - For an **A Record**, use the **external IP address** of the ingress (e.g., `192.168.56.101`).
            - For a `CNAME Record`, use the **hostname** (e.g., `ae33145266d546673c0263t678cb19a31540-1815147026.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com`).
      
       3. Save the changes.
          > **Note: DNS propagation may take some time (usually a few minutes to several hours, depending on your DNS provider's TTL settings).** 

11. **Access the Application over the browser**
    - Once DNS is updated and firewalls are configured, test accessing the application:
       1. Open a web browser and navigate to:
          ```bash
          http://trainbook.com
          ```
       2. You should see the deployed Trainbook application.

## Why Both Blue and Green Deployment Environment Pods Should Be Left in the Cluster

Leaving both **blue** and **green** deployment environment pods in the cluster ensures a robust and flexible deployment strategy. Here's why this approach is beneficial:

1. **Seamless Rollbacks**  
   - If an issue arises with the currently active environment (e.g., blue), the green environment remains available and can be switched back quickly without redeployment. This ensures minimal downtime and faster recovery.

2. **Testing and Validation**  
   - The inactive environment (e.g., green) can be used for further testing and validation of new features or updates without impacting the live environment. This promotes a safer and more controlled deployment process.

3. **Traffic Splitting**  
   - Having both environments active allows for advanced deployment strategies like **canary deployments** or **A/B testing**, where traffic is gradually split between the blue and green environments to observe performance and user behavior.

4. **Disaster Recovery**  
   - In the event of unexpected failures, having both environments ensures that one environment remains operational, significantly reducing downtime and maintaining service availability.

5. **Simplified Deployment Workflow**  
   - Leaving both environments active eliminates the need for re-provisioning pods during every switch. This saves time and resources, especially in high-traffic applications requiring frequent updates.

6. **Consistency Across Updates**  
   - Both environments ensure that the cluster has a backup ready for use, maintaining operational consistency while changes are being applied.

By maintaining both blue and green environments in the cluster, organizations can achieve high availability, enhance deployment flexibility, and minimize risks during updates or transitions.

## Checking the Current Environment (Blue or Green)

To determine whether the **blue** or **green** environment is currently serving traffic, follow these steps:

- **Inspect the Service Selector**
   - The service `trainbook-service` uses a selector to determine which pods it routes traffic to. You can check the selector's value to see the currently active environment.

   Run the following command:
   ```bash
   kubectl get service trainbook-service -n webapps -o yaml
   ```
   Look for the `spec.selector` field in the output. For example:
   
   ```bash
   spec:
     selector:
       app: trainbook-app
       version: blue
   ```
   In this case, the active environment is **blue**.

## Troubleshooting Guide

This section provides a detailed troubleshooting guide for common errors that may arise during the project. Follow these steps to identify and resolve issues effectively.

### 1. Pods Stuck in `ContainerCreating` State
**Cause**: Missing or incorrect configuration, such as invalid volume mounts or incorrect image pulls.  
**Solution**: 
- Check pod logs:
  ```bash
  kubectl logs <pod-name> -n webapps
  ```
- Check pod events:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n webapps
  ```
- Look for errors such as "ImagePullBackOff" or "VolumeMount errors."  
- If it's an image issue:
  ```bash
  kubectl get events -n webapps
  ```
  Ensure the Docker image tag and credentials are correct.
- Verify volume claims:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pvc -n webapps
  ```

### 2. Service `trainbook-service` Not Accessible
**Cause**: Service misconfiguration or external connectivity issues.  
**Solution**:
- Check the service details:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe svc trainbook-service -n webapps
  ```
- Ensure the `ClusterIP` or `LoadBalancer` type is configured properly.
- If using **MetalLB** in Local Environment, verify it is working:
  ```bash
  kubectl get all -n metallb-system
  ```

### 3. Ingress Not Routing Traffic
**Cause**: Misconfigured ingress or external DNS issues.  
**Solution**:
- Check ingress details:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe ingress trinbook-ingress -n webapps
  ```
- Ensure the `HOSTS` match the DNS record (e.g., `trainbook.com`).
- If using NGINX Ingress, verify the ingress controller is running:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -n ingress-nginx
  ```
- Check if the `ADDRESS` field has a valid IP:
  ```bash
  kubectl get ingress -n webapps
  ```

### 4. Switching Traffic manually Between Environments in the cluster. 
- **You can Switch Traffic manually in the cluster at any moment without running the pipeline**.  
**How Do This**:
- Verify the service selector:
  ```bash
  kubectl get svc trainbook-service -n webapps -o yaml
  ```
- Update the selector manually specifying the environment (`green` or `blue`):
  ```bash
  kubectl patch service trainbook-service -p '{"spec": {"selector": {"app": "trainbook-app", "version": "green"}}}' -n webapps
  ```

### 5. Pipeline Failures in Jenkins
**Cause**: Errors in pipeline stages or incorrect configurations.  
**Solution**:
- Check the Jenkins console logs for detailed error messages.
- **Common Errors**:
  - **Git Checkout Failure**: Verify `git-cred` and repository URL are correct.
  - **SonarQube Analysis Fails**: Ensure SonarQube server is reachable and `sonar-server` credentials are valid.
  - **Docker Build Errors**: Ensure Docker is installed and properly configured on the Jenkins agent.
  - **Kubernetes Credentials Issue**: Verify the `k8-cred` secret in Jenkins and ensure the Kubernetes API server is accessible.

### 6. Image Scanning with Trivy Fails
**Cause**: Trivy tool not installed or network issues.  
**Solution**:
- Ensure Trivy is installed and accessible on the Jenkins agent:
  ```bash
  trivy --version
  ```
- Verify network connectivity for pulling vulnerabilities database:
  ```bash
  trivy image <image-name>
  ```

### 7. Deployment Issues in Kubernetes
**Cause**: Misconfigured manifests or insufficient resources.  
**Solution**:
- Check the deployment status:
  ```bash
  kubectl get deployment -n webapps
  kubectl describe deployment <deployment-name> -n webapps
  ```
- Verify resource limits and ensure the cluster has sufficient capacity.

### 8. Application Not Accessible After Deployment
**Cause**: DNS propagation delay or ingress misconfiguration.  
**Solution**:
- Ensure the DNS for `trainbook.com` points to the ingress IP.
- Verify the ingress is exposed and reachable:
  ```bash
  curl http://trainbook.com
  ```

### 9. Email Notifications Not Sent
**Cause**: Incorrect SMTP configuration in Jenkins.  
**Solution**:
- Verify the email configuration in Jenkins:
  ```bash
  Manage Jenkins -> Configure System -> E-mail Notification
  ```
- Ensure the SMTP server is accessible.

By following these troubleshooting steps, you should be able to resolve most issues encountered during the project. For further assistance, refer to the Kubernetes and Jenkins documentation.
