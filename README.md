   - Check that credentials (`git-cred`, `sonar-token`, `docker-cred`, `k8-cred`, `email-cred`) are configured.
     
2. **Ensure all Necessary Manifest Files are added and updated**  
   - Ensure the Kubernetes manifest files are available in the **[Manifest_Files](https://github.com/Godfrey22152/Smart-Traffic-Switching-A-Blue-Green-Deployment-Solution/tree/main/Manifest_Files)** directory of the project repository:
     - `app-deployment-blue.yaml`
     - `app-deployment-green.yaml`
     - `trainbook-secrets.yaml`
     - `trainbook-service.yaml`
     - `trainbook-ingress.yaml`

3. **Run the Pipeline**  
   - Navigate to the newly created pipeline job in Jenkins.
   - Click on **"Build with Parameters"**.
   - Set the parameters for the pipeline:
     - `DEPLOY_ENV`: Choose the deployment environment (`blue` or `green`).
     - `DOCKER_TAG`: Specify the Docker image tag to use (`blue` or `green`).
     - `SWITCH_TRAFFIC`: Toggle the traffic switch box to `true` or leave it unchecked if you don't want the traffic switched from the default `blue` environment.
   - Click **"Build"** to start the pipeline.

4. **Monitor the Pipeline Execution**  
   - View the **console output** to monitor each stage of the pipeline.
   - Confirm that each stage completes successfully.

5. **Verify Deployment**  
   - View **console build output** to verify the deployment:
     - Check that pods, services, and ingress resources in the namespace `webapps` are deployed as specified in the pipeline.
     - Confirm the traffic has been switched (if applicable).
     - If successfully deployed you should see output as shown below (For the `blue` environment):
       
       ```bash
       + kubectl get pods -l version=blue -n webapps
       NAME                                  READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
       trainbook-app-blue-556b67bb58-vg8z7   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          19s
       + kubectl get svc trainbook-service -n webapps
       NAME                TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
       trainbook-service   ClusterIP   10.110.140.55   <none>        80/TCP    64s
       + kubectl get ingress trinbook-ingress -n webapps
       NAME               CLASS   HOSTS           ADDRESS          PORTS   AGE
       trinbook-ingress   nginx   trainbook.com   XXXXXXXXXXXXXX   80      68s
       ```

6. **Review Notifications**
   - The pipeline sends an email with the build status. Verify that notifications are correctly set up for alerts on build status.
     
7. **Verify Pod Readiness**
   - Check that the `trainbook-app` pod in either the **blue** or **green** environments are running and ready:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -l version=blue -n webapps
   kubectl get pods -l version=green -n webapps
   ```
   - Ensure the `READY` column shows `1/1` and the `STATUS` is `Running` as shown below:
   
     ```bash
     NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS     AGE
     trainbook-app-blue-556b67bb58-vg8z7   1/1     Running   0            65m  
     trainbook-app-green-67bcb8d89d-jcg2k  1/1     Running   0            30m
     ```
8. **Verify Service Configuration**
   - Confirm that the `trainbook-service` is running and exposing the application correctly:

     ```bash
     kubectl get svc trainbook-service -n webapps
     
     NAME                TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
     trainbook-service   ClusterIP   10.110.140.55   <none>        80/TCP    2h
     ```
     - Ensure the service type is **ClusterIP** and the port is `80/TCP`.
  
9. **Verify Ingress Configuration**
   - Check the status of the ingress resource:

     ```bash
     kubectl get ingress trinbook-ingress -n webapps
     
     NAME               CLASS   HOSTS           ADDRESS          PORTS   AGE
     trinbook-ingress   nginx   trainbook.com   XXXXXXXXXXXXXX   80      2h
     ```
     - Confirm the following:
       - The `HOSTS` column contains `trainbook.com`.
       - The `ADDRESS` column displays the correct external IP (e.g., `ae33145266d546673c0263t678cb19a31540-1815147026.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com`).
       - The `PORTS` column includes port `80`.

10. **Update Public DNS Records**
    - To make `trainbook.com` accessible remotely, update your public DNS records to point to the external IP of the ingress (e.g., `ae33145266d546673c0263t678cb19a31540-1815147026.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com`):
       1. Log in to your domain registrar's DNS management console.
       2. Add an A Record with the following details:
          - Name: `@` or `trainbook.com`
          - Type: A
          - Value: `ae33145266d546673c0263t678cb19a31540-1815147026.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com`

       3. Save the changes.
          > **Note:** DNS propagation may take some time (usually a few minutes to a few hours).

11. **Access the Application over the browser**
    - Once DNS is updated and firewalls are configured, test accessing the application:
       1. Open a web browser and navigate to:
          ```bash
          http://trainbook.com
          ```
       2. You should see the deployed Trainbook application.

## Why Both Blue and Green Deployment Environment Pods Should Be Left in the Cluster

Leaving both **blue** and **green** deployment environment pods in the cluster ensures a robust and flexible deployment strategy. Here's why this approach is beneficial:

1. **Seamless Rollbacks**  
   - If an issue arises with the currently active environment (e.g., blue), the green environment remains available and can be switched back quickly without redeployment. This ensures minimal downtime and faster recovery.

2. **Testing and Validation**  
   - The inactive environment (e.g., green) can be used for further testing and validation of new features or updates without impacting the live environment. This promotes a safer and more controlled deployment process.

3. **Traffic Splitting**  
   - Having both environments active allows for advanced deployment strategies like **canary deployments** or **A/B testing**, where traffic is gradually split between the blue and green environments to observe performance and user behavior.

4. **Disaster Recovery**  
   - In the event of unexpected failures, having both environments ensures that one environment remains operational, significantly reducing downtime and maintaining service availability.

5. **Simplified Deployment Workflow**  
   - Leaving both environments active eliminates the need for re-provisioning pods during every switch. This saves time and resources, especially in high-traffic applications requiring frequent updates.

6. **Consistency Across Updates**  
   - Both environments ensure that the cluster has a backup ready for use, maintaining operational consistency while changes are being applied.

By maintaining both blue and green environments in the cluster, organizations can achieve high availability, enhance deployment flexibility, and minimize risks during updates or transitions.

## Checking the Current Environment - Blue or Green

To determine whether the **blue** or **green** environment is currently serving traffic, follow these steps:

- **Inspect the Service Selector**
   - The service `trainbook-service` uses a selector to determine which pods it routes traffic to. You can check the selector's value to see the currently active environment.

   Run the following command:
   ```bash
   kubectl get service trainbook-service -n webapps -o yaml
   ```
   Look for the `spec.selector` field in the output. For example:
   
   ```bash
   spec:
     selector:
       app: trainbook-app
       version: blue
   ```
   In this case, the active environment is **blue**.
   
---
## Switching Traffic manually Between Environments in the cluster. 
- **You can Switch Traffic manually in the cluster at any moment without running the pipeline**.  
  **How To Do This**:
   - Verify the service selector:
   ```bash
   kubectl get svc trainbook-service -n webapps -o yaml
   ```
   - Update the selector manually specifying the environment (`green` or `blue`):
   ```bash
   kubectl patch service trainbook-service -p '{"spec": {"selector": {"app": "trainbook-app", "version": "green"}}}' -n webapps
   ```
